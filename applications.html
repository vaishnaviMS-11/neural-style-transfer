  <h1>APPLICATIONS OF NST</h1>
  
  <P>Finally, let's have a look at some of the real-world applications of the Neural Style Transfer.

    <H2>Photo and video editors</H2>
    Style transfer is extensively used in photo and video editing software.
    
    These deep learning approaches and professional style transfer models can easily be applied to devices like mobile phones and give users a real-time ability to style images and videos.
    
    <h2>Art and entertainment</h2>
    Style transfer also provides new techniques that can change the way we look and deal with art.
    
    It makes high-rated and over-priced artistic work reproducible for office and home decor, or for advertisements. Transfer models may help us commercialize art.
    
    <h2>Gaming and Virtual reality</h2>
    There are many cloud-powered video game streams that use image style transfer.
    
    These models help the developers to provide interactive environments with customized artistic styles to users. This provides a 3D touch to the game and helps to enrich the artist inside every developer.
    
    Much similar to gaming, VR apps help to tell visual stories through their applications, games, films, and more.</P>
